> This page applies to SPT version `4.1`
{.is-info}

## [FieldKit](https://sp-mod.com/mod/2856/fieldkit-dev-toolkit-weapon-control-lootentity-browser-spawning-esp>) does not function at all
The current version of the mod is broken. Wait for an update from the mod author.

## All item stacks are set to 1
You installed a mod made for SPT 4.0 to your SPT 4.1 install. [Uninstall it](/SPT_4x/Uninstalling_Mods). Only install versions of mods marked compatible for your version of SPT.

## Greed couldn't find `ServerValueModifier.dll` under `SPT/user/mods/[SVM] Server Value Modifier`
You didn't install SVM correctly. It's installed like any other mod. See the [Installing Mods](/SPT_4x/Installing_Mods) page on how you should install your mods.

## My flea prices are extreme when using [Live Flea Prices](https://sp-mod.com/mod/1131/live-flea-prices)
Those are the prices of items on the Live flea right now. You can check the Live flea [here](<https://tarkov.dev/>).
By default, SPT uses the base handbook price of items +/- some variance when simulating the flea.
To get "normal" flea prices:
- Wait for the Live flea prices to stabilise.
- Set `"pvePrices"` to `true` inside Live Flea Prices' config file to use the PvE Live flea prices instead.
- [Uninstall](/SPT_4x/Uninstalling_Mods) Live Flea Prices.

## When looting bodies only duplicated empty tactical rig slot appears
Update [Foldables](<https://sp-mod.com/mod/2422/foldables>).

## `[UNHANDLED][/sain/_______` errors in the Server
[Update SPT](/SPT_4x/Updating_SPT).

## Server instantly closes
It can have a number of causes:
- Update [SVM](https://sp-mod.com/mod/236/server-value-modifier-svm)
- Update [ISB Aishi](https://sp-mod.com/mod/2478/isb-aishi)
- Uninstall [23x75mm Volna-R Cartridge](https://sp-mod.com/mod/2902/23x75mm-volnar-cartridge)
- See [here](/SPT_41/Known_SPT_Issues_41#server-doesnt-launch-or-closes-immediately)

## Can only list FIR items on the Flea with [The Blacklist](https://sp-mod.com/mod/755/the-blacklist-flea-market-enhancements) installed
Set `"enableFIRFleaSelling"` to `false` in its config.

## `Could not load file or assembly 'X'. An Application Control policy has blocked the file.`
In `Windows Security` > `App & browser control` > `Smart App Control settings` select `Off`.

## `Unable to add item: [id], items must be added before profiles load. Lower the mods TypePriority where items are added to OnLoadOrder.Preload`
Issue present with [BensBurnedWaffles' custom ammo mods](https://sp-mod.com/user/120002/bensburnedwaffles#mods). [Uninstall](/SPT_4x/Uninstalling_Mods) them.

## [APBS](https://sp-mod.com/mod/1594/apbs-acids-progressive-bot-system)'s log grow uncontrollably in file size
Update the mod.

## `Requested value '[bot type]' was not found.` error on loading a raid
[Uninstall](/SPT_4x/Uninstalling_Mods) any outdated mods. Make sure to uninstall them from the `BepInEx\patchers` folder as well.
